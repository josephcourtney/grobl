- [x] make the listed tokenizer output more helpful. For each tokenizer, list models that it applies to.
- [x] set the default tokenizer model to `o200k_base`
- [x] improve the stdout summery header
  - the column indicating inclusion of full text content is labeled with "in" which is not clear
  - the tokens number column is right-aligned but the tokens column label extends two characters to the right of the 1s place. they should be aligned
- [x] include the size of the budget: `Total tokens: 24956 (78% of 32,000 token budget)`
- [x] allow selection of `model` instead of tokenizer which will act as if:
  - `--tokens` was included
  - `--tokenizer TOKENIZER` was included where TOKENIZER is the correct choice for the given model
  - `--budget BUDGET` was included where BUDGET is the input token limit for the given model
    - since the this limit varies by subscription tier, the model can be given bare or suffixed with the tier name, e.g. `gpt-5:plus`
